to-do list:

1 - Bug on dpp.js. If a user chooses 16ch, but then switches back to 4ch the engine will still acknowledge the value.
Update script to reset value to ''.

2 - Improve CSS styles. Fonts are weird and too big.

3 - Add additional comments to some templates.

4 - Whenever user is on a sublink, there should be sopmething on the nav bar saying which WO are they on (i.e. upload, DPP, etc.)
